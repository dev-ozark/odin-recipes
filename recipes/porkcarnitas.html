      <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 crushed clove garlic</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather your ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season pork
        shoulder pieces with salt, then arrange in the oven. Cook until browned
        on every side, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili power, oregano, and cumin. Pour
        in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and
        simmer until pork is quite tender, about 2 1/2 hours
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Â°F.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid.
        Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pieces of pork and lightly
        powder with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle
        more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork while
        it browns.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
