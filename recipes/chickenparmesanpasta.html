      <li>
        2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, six to eight ounces each,

      </li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
      This recipe had the homemade tomato sauce replaced with store-bought,
      which cut out some steps.
    </p>
    <ol class="chicken-steps">
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water, stirring on occasion, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the chicken cutlets: Lay chicken pieces between 2 sheets of
        plastic wrap. Use a mallet or heavy pan to beat chicken to about 1/4
        inch thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg in a shallow dish until well mixed. Season bread crumbs with
        black pepper in another shallow dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven broiler to high. Put a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat
        source.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with one cutlet at a time, dip chicken in beaten egg, then in
        bread crumbs. Set breaded cutlets on a wire rack set over a cookie
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the
        oil simmers
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry breaded cutlets in hot oil until golder brown on each side, about 5
        minutes. Wash and ry the wire rack and return to cookie sheet; place
        fried cutlets on the clean wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top each cutlet with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Broil until cheese
        melts and is brown in spots, about 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Portion pasta onto 4 plates and top each with a chicken cutlet. Spoon 2
        to 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each cutlet, then sauce pasta as
        desired. Serve with extra Parmesan at the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
